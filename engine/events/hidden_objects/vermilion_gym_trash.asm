; Bug: This code should calculate a value in the range [0, 3],
; but if the mask and random number don't have any 1 bits in common, then
; the result of the AND will be 0. When 1 is subtracted from that, the value
; will become $ff. This will result in 255 being added to hl, which will cause
; hl to point to one of the zero bytes that pad the end of the ROM bank.
; Trash can 0 was intended to be able to have the second lock only when the
; first lock was in trash can 1 or 3. However, due to this bug, trash can 0 can
; have the second lock regardless of which trash can had the first lock.
